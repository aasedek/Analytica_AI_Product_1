# **App Name**: Pipeline Pilot

## Core Features:

- Visual Pipeline Design: Offers a drag-and-drop interface for designing data pipelines visually, allowing users to connect pre-configured components representing various data tasks.
- Component-Based Architecture: Provides pre-configured components for common data pipeline tasks like filtering, aggregating, joining, and transforming data, eliminating the need for manual coding.
- Easy Component Configuration: Enables users to configure components through a user-friendly interface, making it easy to select, reorder, and modify data fields without writing SQL commands.
- Visual Pipeline Representation: Breaks down pipelines into visual segments, helping users understand the overall data flow and identify areas for improvement, with descriptive names for each component.
- AI-Powered Optimization: This tool uses AI to analyze pipeline configurations and suggests optimizations for performance, cost, and efficiency.
- Pipeline Export/Import: Allows users to export designed pipelines for reuse in other projects or import them as templates for similar tasks, saving time and ensuring consistency.
- 3D Data Visualization: A tab for 3D data visualization using 3d.js to visualize selected data in a 3D domain

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2979FF) to convey reliability and intelligence, in keeping with data science and software contexts.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) for a clean, modern interface.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#00E676) to highlight key actions and interactive elements, symbolizing growth and efficiency.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and highly readable design, suitable for both headlines and detailed text.
- Use a set of clear, consistent, and minimalist icons to represent different data transformation components.
- Design the layout with a clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing the main canvas for pipeline design and using side panels for component selection and configuration.
